# Quick Summary

## The goal of this project was to create a functioning webapp that could be used to track the attendance of Detachment 440 over the course of the semester. Like a typical app, this goal required a tables for usernames and passwords, comments, and other data manipulation. In the provided example, we have supplied the first week of "ROTC related events" to demonstrate how in given specific timeframe -- say over the course of the week -- the user is responsible for returning to the app and updating the attendance tracker as time goes on.

## Additionally, we styled webpages and content in order to meet requirements for a 2830 Web app development class. This will explain some of the other content present in the page.

## Finally, I believe that this app is by no means trivial, because currently, the amount of manpower and time spent every week validating, entering, and conglomerating paper forms is massive. It's a gratiutious waste of energy and time, and even a solution as rudimentary as the app presented in the video is far better in terms of effectiveness, accuracy, and efficiency.
